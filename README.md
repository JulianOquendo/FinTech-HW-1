# Why Argent is the first crypto wallet that gets it right

## When I read the title for this homework assignment, I knew almost instantaneously which company I wanted to do a deep dive on. Argent, an Ethereum wallet in the simplest terms, launched publicly less than a month ago with tons of hype within the DeFi community. Since late May, I have played around with almost every feature offered through the application and have concluded that this will be the wallet that takes crypto to the next level. Here we go…

* Argent

* Founded in December of 2017.

* Founded by Itamar Lesuisse, Gerald Goldstein & Julian Niset.

* The idea for the company came about after Itamar made his first purchase of Ether back in 2016. He knew that he had a passion for the field and after some digging around, he decided that usability and security were the two impeding factors to mainstream adoption…so he set out to fix that. Through the combination of a mobile native wallet and a heightened focus on cryptography, they hoped to give users a wallet that afforded more control or their holdings.

* The company is funded through 3 separate investment rounds from reputable VC’s; Two in 2018 that raised a cumulative $4MM and then a third round in early 2020 that raised around $12MM. Participating crypto funds invested in the project include Paradigm, Index Ventures & others. The total funding is $16MM to date.

## Business Activities:

* The specific financial problem the company is trying to solve is two-fold:
    1.	The difficulty in navigating various DeFi apps to generate a higher yield on your portfolio of Ether or ERC-20 tokens by more easily providing a suite of investment options under one platform.
    2.	The inherent security issues around holding digital assets by adding different mechanisms to help the user feel more confident about the ownership of their funds.

* The company’s intended customer is the entire ecosystem of DeFi users, and then eventually to link up to every single bank account in the world. Currently, the user base in DeFi is growing rapidly and is expected to reach about one million users by March of 2021 at its current growth rate (According to Richard Chen). 

* The unfair advantage they offer that their competitors do not is that they have centralized the marketplace for DeFi apps under one, simple to use tool. Essentially, it is a multi-faceted bank masked as a wallet, allowing the user to invest in 8 different DeFi apps to date with a few simple swipes of their iPhone. It allows users to take advantage of various lending, borrowing and trading protocols without ever having to leave the Argent app; No longer do you have to endure the painstaking process of visiting a million different websites and integrating Ethereum wallets as Argent has now put everything under one secure umbrella.

* The main technology they are currently using are Ethereum "Smart Contracts", as the entire framework of the wallet is built on top of these. A smart contract, in short, is a transaction that executes automatically according to the terms of the pre-coded contract or agreement.

## Landscape:

* The domain of the financial industry that Argent belongs to is cryptocurrency, more specifically the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) realm of crypto. On the broader level, "Decentralized Finance" aims to re-create a financial system that is open to everyone and anyone, and minimizes one’s need to trust and rely on central authorities such as banks. This truly has the opportunity to bring about a more transparent and inviting financial system, allowing anyone with an internet connection the ability to access and interact with smart contracts built on the Ethereum network.

* The major trends and innovation of this domain over the last 5-10 years is, well, everything! Bitcoin really kicked things off in 2008 and the field has been growing and maturing ever since. In my opinion, the most important trend in the space will be the adoption of smart contracts for business and the advent of people taking back the power of investing their own wealth via DeFi services. We still have a long ways to go but it seems like the next 10 years will be very bullsih for the growth and adoption of Crytpocurrency.

* The other major companies in this domain of DeFi are Compound, Kyber & Aave. The major players in the larger domain of cryptocurrency are Coinbase, Gemini, Grayscale and others that have since become household names, depending on the household...

## Results

* The business impact of Argent has been rather minute to date, as the application only transitioned from the beta version to public availability less than a month ago. Albeit, the founders seem very content with the level of users that are signing up and even more so with the engagement; The average wallet holds the equivalent of $2,000 USD in their accounts, invested across Ether and other tokens that are generating generous amounts of interest for the owner. This is only just beginning!

* The core metric that companies in this domain use to measure success is Total Value Locked (USD) in DeFi. Across all DeFi apps, the amount of USD locked in DeFi just crossed the $1B threshold again for the first time since the March crash and as of June 27th, the TVL is sitting at $1.65 Billion USD locked in DeFi.

* The company is performing relatively well but it is still so, so, so early on. As for wallets, they are usually judged by the amount of active addresses they maintain. Really this just means how many individual wallets are actually sending or receiving funds over a certain period of time (usually 3 months). As of their launch in May, Argent had 3,000 users interacting with the wallet during the beta period and another 1,000 on the waiting list. The total number of wallet addresses created since the inception of Bitcoin just passed 47,000,000 this past May, so Argent definitely has its work cut it for them to start gaining significant market share! 

## Recommendations 

* If I were to advise the company… I would suggest they implement a feature to more easily track the prices or performance of the various tokens that you can exchange for. Right now they do not have a mechanism for this, and it leaves the user having to check external websites such as DeFi Pulse to figure out how certain tokens are tracking. Introducing a native scoreboard of sorts would make the user experience much better as it would improve the transparency. It may be as simple as better showcasing the native decentralized exchange on the wallet, Kyber, and highlighting their exchange prices in a more intuitive manner. 

* All in all, I highly recommend Argent to anyone looking to dip their toes into the world of DeFi and start farming yield!
